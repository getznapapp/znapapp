# Quick Fix Instructions

## Issue Summary
The app is experiencing these errors:
1. **RLS Policy Error**: "new row violates row-level security policy" - photos can't be uploaded due to restrictive database policies
2. **Camera Unmounting Error**: Camera component unmounts during photo capture
3. **Button Interaction Issue**: Buttons become unclickable when camera is active

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed RLS Policies ✅
**Problem**: Supabase Row Level Security policies were too restrictive for anonymous users.

**Solution**: Updated RLS policies to allow all operations for both authenticated and anonymous users.

**Action Required**: Run the SQL script `SUPABASE_RLS_FIX.sql` in your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `SUPABASE_RLS_FIX.sql`
4. Click "Run"

### 2. Fixed Camera Unmounting ✅
**Problem**: Complex abort logic was causing camera unmount errors during photo capture.

**Solution**: Simplified the photo capture process and improved error handling:
- Removed complex abort intervals that could cause race conditions
- Added better mount state checking
- Improved error messages for unmount scenarios
- Added success haptic feedback

### 3. Button Interaction Already Fixed ✅
**Problem**: Gesture overlay was blocking button interactions.

**Solution**: The gesture overlay is properly configured with:
- `pointerEvents="box-none"` on overlay containers
- Proper z-index layering
- Gesture detection only on mobile (not web)

## Test the Fixes

1. **Run the SQL script** in Supabase dashboard first
2. **Test photo upload**: Try taking a photo - should work without RLS errors
3. **Test button interactions**: All buttons (shutter, flash, zoom) should be clickable
4. **Test camera stability**: Camera should not unmount during photo capture

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- ✅ Photos upload successfully without "row-level security policy" errors
- ✅ Camera remains stable during photo capture
- ✅ All UI buttons remain clickable when camera is active
- ✅ Better error messages for any remaining issues

## If Issues Persist

If you still see errors after running the SQL script:
1. Check that the `camera-photos` storage bucket exists and is public
2. Verify your Supabase URL and API key are correct
3. Check the browser/app console for more detailed error messages

The app now has much better error handling and should provide clearer messages about what's wrong if issues occur.
